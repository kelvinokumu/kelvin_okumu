          The SQL Analysis of NYC Taxi Trips project involves leveraging SQL
          querying techniques to gain profound insights from the extensive NYC
          taxi trips dataset. By scrutinizing ride patterns, popular locations,
          and fare trends, we aim to uncover actionable intelligence for service
          enhancement. This project showcases how SQL can effectively transform
          data into valuable recommendations for optimizing urban
          transportation.

            The project involves creating a comprehensive database system for a pizza 
            ordering and sales business. This database schema includes tables for orders, 
            order details, pizzas, and pizza types, capturing essential information 
            about orders, pizza types, sizes, and prices. 
            A series of meticulously designed SQL queries then analyze the data to offer 
            actionable insights. These insights encompass aspects such as top-selling pizza 
            types, revenue trends by category and month, customer behavior on weekdays and 
            weekends, and popular ordering hours, providing a holistic view of the business's 
            performance and aiding strategic decision-making.

          The TMDB Movies dataset is a comprehensive collection of movie-related
          data from The Movie Database, encompassing details like movie titles,
          release dates, genres, cast, crew, budgets, revenue, and user ratings.
          This dataset is frequently employed for tasks such as data analysis
          and machine learning projects within the film industry. Exploring this
          dataset involves data cleaning, conducting exploratory data analysis
          to uncover trends in genres, revenue, and user ratings, analyzing
          actors and directors associated with successful films, and potentially
          building predictive models to estimate box office performance or
          ratings based on various features. It's important to be aware of
          potential biases and limitations in the dataset while drawing
          conclusions.
